A simple implementation of the DeepDream Algorithm using PyTorch

#### About
The weights were used from a pretrained VGG16 architecture, with slight changes the same code can be used for any other custom architecture.<br>

#### Usage
Run the ```dream.ipynb``` notebook. You can choose not to save the images in a gif format by simply commenting out that block of code. Below is an example of running the code on 20 iterations of the algorithm.
